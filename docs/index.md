# Characters To Pixels Image
A software for characters to colored pixels image en- and decoding.

## Introduction
Hello and welcome here,
The software you are looking about is a simple desktop application encoder/decoder that can encode/decode a plain text into an image that consists of pixels of different colors. Each character (letter, number, etc.) has a specific color code. Characters-to-colors configuration is written in JSON and easy to edit so you can customize the cypher pretty easy. Sure, you can save a generated image into file and you can also open an image of this type to decode. SRL stands for Standard Recognizable Library â€” this is the standard characters-to-colors configuration that the software uses as default. "Inject RL" allows you to use your own recognizable library, as said above. There are also some options like "output type", "pixels spacing" and "clear previous text on open". The first one allows you to choose the format an image saves into; the second one changes the amount of "empty" (transparent) pixels between colored (just for decorational purposes); and the last one, when toggled on, clears previous decoded text if you had opened a new one.
Thanks for checking, and probably, using this tiny application,
Have a nice day!
