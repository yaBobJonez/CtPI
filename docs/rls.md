# Recognizable Libraries

Recognizable Libraries (RLs) are JSON-structured .ctpn files those contain data for CtPI what character to encode into what color.
Those libraries allow you to customize the "cypher" and support almost every Unicode character and every possible color. RLs support
3 kinds of color definitions: color hex (#RRGGBB; recommended), simple names (black, green, etc.) and hex with transparency
(#RRGGBBAA; still in W.I.P.).

## Standard RL

SRL is standard RL compiled into the software and provided as default upon CtPI launch. Here you can find the defauld configuration:
